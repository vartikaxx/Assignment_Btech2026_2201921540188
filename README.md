Problem Statement 1:
Write a Java program to create a class called "GymMembership" with attributes for member name, membership type, and duration. Create a subclass "PremiumMembership" that adds attributes for personal trainer availability and spa access. Implement methods to calculate membership fees and check for special offers based on membership type.

Platform used:
w3resource

Approach:
Firstly, we'll create a parent class named "GymMembership", we'll create the following:
constructor: to take in the values of members
display method: to display the details of members
fees method: total amount to be paid for the gym
offers method: any discount available for the members on basis of their membership type

Secondly, we'll create a subclass named "PremiumMembership", we'll create the following:
constructor: to take in the values from members
fees method: to add additional fee to members fees if they say to yes to personal trainer or spa access or both
display method: prints the details of members

In the main function, we'll create objects for both the classes and call them.
